# superagent-oauth

A handy [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) plugin to use ECP to auth
requests for you

## Example

```js
var url = "https://printing.johnscompany.com/balance",
	username = "john",
	password = "somepassword",
	ecp = "https://gateway.johnscompany.com/idp/profile/SAML2/SOAP/ECP";

// Libraries
var request = require("superagent");
require("./superagent-ecp")(request); // Add ECP

request
  .get(url)
  .buffer(true)
  .ecp(ecp, username, password, function(req){
    req.end(function (res) {
      console.log(res.status);
      var p = res.text.indexOf("Â£");
      console.log("Print Credit: " + res.text.substring( p, res.text.indexOf("<", p) ));
    });
  });
```

## API

### Request#ecp

```js
Request#ecp(idp_endpoint, username, password)
```

- **idp_endpoint**: (`String`) Endpoint for IDP Authentication
- **username**: (`String`) Username to access the resource with
- **password**: (`String`) Passwod to access with. Shocking as it is, this whole complex
ECP thing literally uses plain-text :O

#### idp_endpoint guessing

You can guess this fairly easy. If you try and use the service by-hand (and depending if ECP
is enabled for the resource in question).

For example if when you access the resource you are redirected to something like
`https://idp.mycompany.com/idp/Authnengine`

Then you simply take from `/idp/` and make it `/idp/idp/profile/SAML2/SOAP/ECP`
